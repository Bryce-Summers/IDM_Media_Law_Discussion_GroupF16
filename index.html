<h2>Purpose</h2>

<div class='description'>

Wouldn't it be neat if we, the Media Law students, could meet up each week and discuss terms, references, and ideas
related to the Media Law class? Reading, writing, and understanding can be hard, even for native English speakers with years of practice,
so this page is meant to help coordinate group discussion of the Media Law course material outside of class in a way
that we can learn from each other and support each other's individual strengths and weaknesses.

</div>

<h3>When do we meet?</h3>

<div class='description'>

We have yet to decide on meeting times yet. If you are interested in taking part in the discussion group,
please visit and fill out the when2meet poll at <a href="http://when2meet.com/?5430666-uOBT1">http://when2meet.com/?5430666-uOBT1</a>
and put down your preferred times during a normal week. If we find a good time, then we can meet inside of the Magnet building each week
to talk about the ideas from the course.
